# Tutor.AI — Your AI Co-Teacher Everywhere

## Vision

Education today is broken into silos: YouTube videos, Zoom sessions, in-person classes, and traditional LMS systems (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle). None of them deliver a **personal AI tutor** that travels with the student everywhere. Tutor.AI changes this.

We are building the **world’s first AI Co-Teacher platform** that seamlessly integrates with all major LMS platforms and also works as a standalone app. Students and teachers will finally have one consistent, personalized AI-powered learning experience — no matter where they study or teach.

## The Problem with Existing LMS

* **Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle** → Store content, track progress, host quizzes. But they don’t teach.
* **YouTube & Zoom classes** → Great for delivery, but not interactive or personalized.
* **Teachers** → Spend too much time making quizzes, summaries, and grading.
* **Students** → Struggle with self-study, get lost in content, and lack real-time personalized help.
